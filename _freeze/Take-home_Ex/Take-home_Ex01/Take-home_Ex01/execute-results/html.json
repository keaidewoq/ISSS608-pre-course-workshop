Understanding the intricate relationship between student demographics, individual perceptions, and external variables is essential for fostering an effective learning environment. Furthermore, these insights empower lecturers, academic advisors, and educational administrators to implement timely interventions, ultimately enhancing overall student performance.\n\n## 1.2 Our Task\n\nFor this take-home exercise, both descriptive and inferential methods are employed to explore survey data. Utilizing visually-driven analysis, this report reveals and communicates key observations. The primary focus is on identifying patterns, trends, and relationships within the responses to interpret results effectively and inform data-driven decision-making.\n\n# 2 Install and load Packages\n\nIn this exercise, we will utilize eight R packages to facilitate data import, manipulation, and advanced visualization:\n\n-   **readxl**: For importing data from Excel spreadsheets.\n\n-   **tidyverse**: A collection of fundamental R packages designed for data science, covering everything from data cleaning to creating static statistical graphs.\n\n-   **ggthemes**: Provides additional themes, geometries, and scales to extend the styling capabilities of `ggplot2`.\n\n-   **ggstatsplot**: Enhances `ggplot2` by adding the results of statistical tests directly onto information-rich plots.\n\n-   **patchwork**: An intuitive tool for combining multiple `ggplot2` objects into a single composite figure.\n\nThe following code chunk checks for the presence of these packages, installs any that are missing, and loads them into your R environment.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npacman::p_load(readxl, tidyverse, ggthemes, ggstatsplot, patchwork)\n```\n:::\n\n\n# 3 Data Preparation\n\n## 3.1 The data\n\nFor this take-home exercise, we will use the **\"Dataset of factors affecting learning outcomes of students at the University of Education, Vietnam National University, Hanoi,\"** which was downloaded from \\[<https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/23ppcdbmhc/1>\\].\n\nThis dataset was constructed to facilitate research into student management and the diverse factors influencing academic performance. The data was gathered via a survey conducted from March to June 2023, resulting in **2,170 responses** from students and alumni of the University of Education (VNU-UEd). The data is stored in a file named `Database paper.xlsx` within the `Dataset about VNU studnets` sub-folder of the project directory.\n\n## 3.2 Import Data\n\nThe following code chunk utilizes the `read_excel()` function from the **readxl** package to import the dataset into the R environment.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsurvey_data <- read_excel(\"./Dataset about VNU students/Database paper.xlsx\")\n```\n:::\n\n\nThe `survey_data` tibble consists of **22 variables**, all of which are **categorical**. These can be further classified into nominal and ordinal data types:\n\n-   **Nominal Variables (6):** These variables represent categories with no inherent rank or numerical order. They include:\n\n    -   `Gender`, `Policy_Stu`, `Minority_Stu`, `Poor_Stu`, `Father_Occupation`, and `Mother_Occupation`.\n\n-   **Ordinal Variables (16):** These variables represent categories with a logical sequence or scale (e.g., education levels or Likert scales). They include:\n\n    -   **Demographics & Habits:** `Year`, `Father_Edu`, `Mother_Edu`, `Time_Friends`, `Time_SocicalMedia`, `Time_Studying`, and `GPA`.\n\n    -   **Perceptions & Environment (Likert Scales):** `Adapt_Learning_Uni`, `Study_Methods`, `SupportOf_Uni`, `SupportOf_Lec`, `Facilitie_Uni`, `Quality_Lecturer`, `TrainingCurriculum`, `Competitive_Class`, and `InfluenceF_Friends`.\n\n## 3.3 Preparing the Data\n\n### 3.3.1 Check Missing Values\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsum(is.na(survey_data))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 0\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nA preliminary data validation check confirmed that the dataset contains no missing values (NAs) across all 22 variables, ensuring a complete sample of 2,170 observations for analysis.\n\n### 3.3.2 Data Wrangling and Factoring\n\nRaw numeric survey responses were recoded into meaningful text labels and converted into factors to ensure logical sequencing for visualization using the code chunk below.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsurvey_data <- survey_data %>%\n  mutate(\n    #

Specifically, the proportion of students achieving a **'Good'** GPA increases from **25% to 38%** for Father's education and from **25% to 37%** for Mother's education.\n\n-   **Consistency Across Parents:** The impact is remarkably consistent between both parents. In both cases, the dominant GPA category shifts from **'Fair' (62%)** in the Basic group to a more balanced distribution between **'Fair' (49%)** and **'Good' (\\~37%)** in the Higher Education group.\n\n-   **Statistical Significance:** The extremely low $p$-values ($p < .001$) across all groups confirm that these distributions are not random and that parental educational attainment is a robust indicator of a student's academic trajectory.\n:::\n\n### 4.4.2 Behavioral Habits & Time Usage\n\nIn this section, we evaluate how time spent on studying, social media, and interacting with friends affects student performance.

A significant dip to **23.4%** occurs at the 2–4 hour mark, suggesting moderate effort may be insufficient.\n\n-   **Socializing:** A \"sweet spot\" exists at **1–2 hours** daily (**38.5%** success). Effectiveness declines as social time exceeds 3 hours, likely due to time displacement.\n\nTo maximize success, the data suggests prioritizing **6+ hours of study**, limiting social media to **under 4 hours**, and maintaining a balanced **1–2 hours of social interaction**.\n:::\n\n## 4.5 Institutional & Environmental Factors\n\nThis section evaluates the institutional environment and its perceived influence on learning.

The evidence proves that success is more closely linked to longitudinal factors—specifically parental education and professional synergy—than to the immediate institutional setting.\n\nWhile the university provides a high-quality environment, particularly regarding lecturer quality, there is a clear \"decoupling\" between student perception and actual performance. Statistical analysis reveals that satisfaction with facilities and support does not function as a direct determinant of grades. Ultimately, the university serves as a backdrop, while the primary pillars of excellence remain the socio-professional capital and behavioral habits students establish prior to and outside of the campus ecosystem.\n\n# 6 References\n\n-   [Codebook of the Dataset](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/23ppcdbmhc/1)\n",
