In this hands-on exercise, you will learn how to create animated data visualisation by using **gganimate** and **plotly r** packages. At the same time, you will also learn how to (i) reshape data by using **tidyr** package, and (ii) process, wrangle and transform data by using **dplyr** package.\n\n### 1.1 Basic concepts of animation\n\nWhen creating animations, the plot does not actually move. Instead, many individual plots are built and then stitched together as movie frames, just like an old-school flip book or cartoon. Each frame is a different plot when conveying motion, which is built using some relevant subset of the aggregate data. The subset drives the flow of the animation when stitched back together.\n\n![](images/clipboard-1859662484.png)\n\n### 1.2 Terminology\n\nBefore we dive into the steps for creating an animated statistical graph, it’s important to understand some of the key concepts and terminology related to this type of visualization.\n\n1.  **Frame**: In an animated line graph, each frame represents a different point in time or a different category. When the frame changes, the data points on the graph are updated to reflect the new data.\n\n2.  **Animation Attributes**: The animation attributes are the settings that control how the animation behaves. For example, you can specify the duration of each frame, the easing function used to transition between frames, and whether to start the animation from the current frame or from the beginning.\n\n::: callout-tip\n## Tip\n\nBefore you start making animated graphs, you should first ask yourself: Does it makes sense to go through the effort? If you are conducting an exploratory data analysis, a animated graphic may not be worth the time investment. However, if you are giving a presentation, a few well-placed animated graphics can help an audience connect with your topic remarkably better than static counterparts.\n:::\n\n## 2 Getting Started\n\n### 2.1 Loading the R packages\n\nFirst, write a code chunk to check, install and load the following R packages:\n\n-   [**plotly**](https://plotly.com/r/), R library for plotting interactive statistical graphs.\n\n-   [**gganimate**](https://gganimate.com/), an ggplot extension for creating animated statistical graphs.\n\n-   [**gifski**](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/gifski/index.html) converts video frames to GIF animations using pngquant’s fancy features for efficient cross-frame palettes and temporal dithering. It produces animated GIFs that use thousands of colors per frame.\n\n-   [**gapminder**](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/gapminder/index.html): An excerpt of the data available at Gapminder.org. We just want to use its *country_colors* scheme.\n\n-   [**tidyverse**](https://www.tidyverse.org/), a family of modern R packages specially designed to support data science, analysis and communication task including creating static statistical graphs.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npacman::p_load(readxl, gifski, gapminder,\nplotly, gganimate, tidyverse)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n\n  There is a binary version available but the source version is later:\n           binary   source needs_compilation\ndata.table 1.18.0 1.18.2.1              TRUE\n\npackage 'plotly' successfully unpacked and MD5 sums checked\n\nThe downloaded binary packages are in\n\tC:\\Users\\笑口常开\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\Rtmp48V2ad\\downloaded_packages\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### 2.2 Importing the data\n\nIn this hands-on exercise, the *Data* worksheet from *GlobalPopulation* Excel workbook will be used.\n\nWrite a code chunk to import Data worksheet from GlobalPopulation Excel workbook by using appropriate R package from tidyverse family.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncol <- c(\"Country\", \"Continent\")\nglobalPop <- read_xls(\"data/GlobalPopulation.xls\",\n                      sheet=\"Data\") %>%\n  mutate_each_(funs(factor(.)), col) %>%\n  mutate(Year = as.integer(Year))\n```\n:::\n\n\n::: callout-note\n## Things to learn from the code chunk above\n\n-   [`read_xls()`](https://readxl.tidyverse.org/reference/read_excel.html) of **readxl** package is used to import the Excel worksheet.\n\n-   `mutate_each_()` of dplyr package is used to convert all character data type into factor.\n\n-   `mutate` of dplyr package is used to convert data values of Year field into integer.\n:::\n\nUnfortunately, `mutate_each_()` was deprecated in dplyr 0.7.0. and `funs()` was deprecated in dplyr 0.8.0. In view of this, we will re-write the code by using [`mutate_at()`](https://r4va.netlify.app/chap04) as shown in the code chunk below.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncol <- c(\"Country\", \"Continent\")\nglobalPop <- read_xls(\"data/GlobalPopulation.xls\",\n                      sheet=\"Data\") %>%\n  mutate_at(col, as.factor) %>%\n  mutate(Year = as.integer(Year))\n```\n:::\n\n\nInstead of using `mutate_at()`, [`across()`](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/across.html) can be used to derive the same outputs.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncol <- c(\"Country\", \"Continent\")\nglobalPop <- read_xls(\"data/GlobalPopulation.xls\",\n                      sheet=\"Data\") %>%\n  mutate(across(col, as.factor)) %>%\n  mutate(Year = as.integer(Year))\n```\n:::\n\n\n## 3 Animated Data Visualisation: gganimate methods\n\n[**gganimate**](https://gganimate.com/) extends the grammar of graphics as implemented by ggplot2 to include the description of animation. It does this by providing a range of new grammar classes that can be added to the plot object in order to customise how it should change with time.\n\n-   `transition_*()` defines how the data should be spread out and how it relates to itself across time.\n\n-   `view_*()` defines how the positional scales should change along the animation.\n\n-   `shadow_*()` defines how data from other points in time should be presented in the given point in time.\n\n-   `enter_*()/exit_*()` defines how new data should appear and how old data should disappear during the course of the animation.\n\n-   `ease_aes()` defines how different aesthetics should be eased during transitions.\n\n### 3.1 Building a static population bubble plot\n\nIn the code chunk below, the basic ggplot2 functions are used to create a static bubble plot.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(globalPop, aes(x = Old, y = Young, \n                      size = Population, \n                      colour = Country)) +\n  geom_point(alpha = 0.7, \n             show.legend = FALSE) +\n  scale_colour_manual(values = country_colors) +\n  scale_size(range = c(2, 12)) +\n  labs(title = 'Year: {frame_time}', \n       x = '% Aged', \n       y = '% Young') \n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Hands-on_Ex03b_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### 3.2 Building the animated bubble plot\n\nIn the code chunk below,\n\n-   [`transition_time()`](https://gganimate.com/reference/transition_time.html) of **gganimate** is used to create transition through distinct states in time (i.e. Year).\n\n-   `ease_aes()` is used to control easing of aesthetics. The default is `linear`. Other methods are: quadratic, cubic, quartic, quintic, sine, circular, exponential, elastic, back, and bounce.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(globalPop, aes(x = Old, y = Young, \n                      size = Population, \n                      colour = Country)) +\n  geom_point(alpha = 0.7, \n             show.legend = FALSE) +\n  scale_colour_manual(values = country_colors) +\n  scale_size(range = c(2, 12)) +\n  labs(title = 'Year: {frame_time}', \n       x = '% Aged', \n       y = '% Young') +\n  transition_time(Year) +       \n  ease_aes('linear') \n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Hands-on_Ex03b_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.gif)\n:::\n:::\n\n",
