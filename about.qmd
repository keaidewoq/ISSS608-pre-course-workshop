I am a Master of IT in Business (Data Science and Analytics) student at Singapore Management University, graduating in Dec 2026. With a background in Pharmacy, I am passionate about bridging the gap between healthcare expertise and data-driven decision-making.

Currently, I'm diving deep into Visual Analytics (ISSS608) and building my portfolio in R and Python.
